# Intellectual data validation in industrial databases
See the process of developing an intelligent data validation system using Bayesian networks.

As part of the solution of the anomaly detection problem, 3 algorithms have been developed:
- based on the comparison of BN structures (`Structures comparasion`) 
- based on the solution of the classification problem (`Classification`)
- based on the combining semantic segmentation algorithms and BN (`Unet+BN`)
